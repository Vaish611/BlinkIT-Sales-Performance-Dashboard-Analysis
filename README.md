# Project Overview

This project presents a BlinkIT Data Dashboard that analyzes sales performance across different categories, outlet types, outlet sizes, and item fat content. The dashboard highlights total sales by product category to identify top-performing segments. It compares the sum of ratings and sum of sales across different outlet location tiers. The analysis also includes item fat content distribution by outlet type. Key KPIs such as total sales (1.20M), total ratings (33K), and item fat content count (8523) are prominently displayed. Sales distribution is further analyzed by outlet size (Medium, Small, High). The dashboard uses bar charts and donut charts for clear comparison. Overall, it provides a structured view of sales trends and performance segmentation.

# KPI Questions (5 Most Relevant)

1.Which product category generates the highest total sales?

2.How do sales and ratings compare across Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 outlet locations?

3.Which outlet type has the highest count of item fat content?

4.What is the sales contribution of Low Fat vs Regular items?

5.How does sales distribution vary across Medium, Small, and High outlet sizes?

# Process 

I started by organizing the sales data by product categories to identify the highest contributors. Then, I compared outlet location tiers to analyze the relationship between ratings and sales. I calculated the total ratings, total sales, and total item fat content count as key KPIs. After that, I segmented sales by item fat content to understand customer preference patterns. I also analyzed outlet types to determine where item distribution is highest. Finally, I visualized sales distribution by outlet size to compare performance clearly.

# Project Insights 
Fruits and Vegetables and Snack Foods are the top-performing categories in total sales. Tier 3 outlets generate the highest sales compared to Tier 1 and Tier 2. Supermarket Type1 has the highest count of item fat content among outlet types. Regular fat items contribute significantly more to total sales than Low Fat items. Medium-sized outlets account for the largest share of total sales. High-sized outlets contribute the lowest portion compared to Medium and Small outlets. The dashboard clearly shows that category performance and outlet segmentation strongly influence overall sales distribution.
